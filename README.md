# InventoryDemo

This inventory demo is a work in progress for a game I am designing. The demo is to provide an experience of using random generation to fill chests up with items that you can take and store in your inventory. The process allows generation of items, the ability to take the items out and store them in your inventory, close the chests, revist them with the same loot. This demo also creates a save file in the User directory to give the ability to load progress when restarting game.
